# Segment Notes :

# Within EANCOMÂ® the use of the UNG..UNE segments should not be used for 
# grouping of multiple message types in the same interchange as this is 
# not considered good practice. However, they can be used by organisations 
# to create their own identifiable application level envelopes, which can 
# be addressed from the originating department to a department in the 
# recipient's system, e.g. to group multiple issuers in one transmission 
# file with invoices.

# Example :

# UNE+25+471123'
